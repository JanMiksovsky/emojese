# Challenges creating a visual language with emoji

Are there enough contemporary Unicode emoji to support visual communication of complex ideas entirely in reasonably recognizable emoji?

No ‚Äî at least, not yet. Too much is missing.

The [Emojese emoji language](https://emojese.org) project takes a shot at assigning intuitive emoji representations of a reasonably large vocabulary for general communication. There are already enough emoji to make that possible, but many common words have no obvious representation emoji.

1. While there are some 1300 emoji (not counting skin tones), they are over-concentrated in a few areas, particularly facial expressions, hearts, animals, foods, occupations, and cultural touchstones.
2. There are very few verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, or pronouns. Setting aside the fact that there is no widely-understood grammar that could tie these together ‚Äî there simply aren‚Äôt enough basic building blocks to express many common thoughts in emoji.
3. Reviewing lists of common English words, emoji is missing obvious representations of the many of the most common words found in English (and, presumably, most other languages).
4. The current emoji submission process does not seem driven by a process likely to fill in the missing pieces soon, or in a systematic manner.

But, given sufficient interest and organization, this state of affairs can be changed.

## Words without obvious emoji

To motivate the current situation with concrete examples, here‚Äôs a list of very common English words which Emojese struggles to express in emoji. The Frequency number gives the word‚Äôs position in a list of 500 most frequent words in the [Oxford English Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Corpus). (Frequency analysis by [sketchengine.eu](https://www.sketchengine.eu/english-word-list/).) While the OEC may not be representative of contemporary text messages that include emoji, if a word is in the OEC‚Äôs top 500, it‚Äôs an _extremely_ common English word.

Emojese uses üéí Backpack and ‚Üí Rightwards Arrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | üéí‚Üí              | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_carry_2696191.svg" style="width: 200px">          |

An emoji that included a mouth and something with a bite out of it would better convey the act of eating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | üçΩÔ∏è               | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_Apple Bite_1305039.svg" style="width: 200px">     |
| end                      | 199    | No obvious emoji. Emojese uses üèÅ Chequered Flag for its association with the end of an auto race, but this meaning may be lost on many people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | üèÅ               |

| fall (action)            |        | No obvious representation of something actively falling. Emojese uses üçÅ Maple Leaf for its association with falling leaves. (Ironically, üçÇ Fallen Leaf doesn‚Äôt seem to convey that as well, as the leaves may be interpreted to have already fallen.) The metaphoric association can work, but an icon showing something falling (like a <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=fall&i=1887964">person falling</a>) would be clearer.                                                                                                                   | üçÅ               | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_falling_1887964.svg" style="width: 200px">        |
| fall (season)            |        | Adopting üçÅ Maple Leaf for the verb ‚Äúfall‚Äù (above) means that emoji cannot also be used on its own to unambiguously reference the season. Emojese generally uses ‚è∞ Alarm Clock to represent the concept of time, so: ‚Äúfalling leaf time‚Äù.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | üçÅ‚è∞             |

Emojese uses a resultative complement (see ‚Äúbecome‚Äù) to show ‚õ∫ Tent close up, followed by üèï Camping with a smaller tent.

| feel                     | 216    | Another challenging abstract concept. There are many emoji for feelings, but none to represent the general state or concept of feeling thing. Emojese uses categorization brackets (see ‚Äúanimal‚Äù above) to represent the general category of feelings, plus ‚áù Rightwards Squiggle Arrow to convey action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [üòÄ]‚üø            |                                                                                         |

Emojese uses ü™û Mirror with ü§¢ Nauseated Face to represents a reaction to ugliness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ü™ûü§¢             |

| we/us                    | 26/93  | Like I/me, these are extremely frequent words. Two or more people with arms over shoulders begins to capture the concept. As with ‚ÄúI‚Äù, it might help to have one or more of the people pointing to themselves. It‚Äôs hard to use existing emoji like üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë People Holding Hands that have a specific appearance (skin tone, outfit) if the ‚Äúwe‚Äù being expressed don‚Äôt look like that. Emojese settles for reduplication of the same üëá Backhand Index Pointing Down to uses for ‚ÄúI‚Äù to form ‚ÄúI plural‚Äù, i.e., ‚Äúwe‚Äù.                                                  | üëáüëá             | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_together_1742410.svg" style="width: 200px" />     |
| wear                     |        | There are various emoji for articles of clothing, but nothing for the action of getting dressed. Emojese uses üëñ Jeans with ‚áù Rightwards Squiggle Arrow to convey action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | üëñ‚üø              |
| week                     | 263    | As with ‚Äúmonth‚Äù and ‚Äúyear‚Äù, there is no emoji for this division of time. Icons for <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?ek">week</a> often highlight a single row in a month calendar. Emojese uses ‚òÄÔ∏è Sun for ‚Äúday‚Äù, adding ‚ìª Double Circled Digit Seven: ‚Äúseven days‚Äù.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | ‚ìª‚òÄÔ∏è              | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_week_247256.svg" style="width: 200px">            |

| year                     | 121    | As with ‚Äúweek‚Äù and ‚Äúmonth‚Äù, there is no emoji for this division of time.
