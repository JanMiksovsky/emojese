# Challenges creating a visual language with emoji

Are there enough contemporary Unicode emoji to support visual communication of complex ideas entirely in emoji?

No — at least, not yet. Too much is missing.

The [Emojese](https://emojese.org) project takes a shot at assigning intuitive emoji representations of a reasonably large vocabulary for general communication. There are already enough emoji to make that possible, but many common words have no obvious representation emoji.

1. While there are some 1300 emoji (not counting skin tones), they are over-concentrated in a few areas, particularly facial expressions, things many people tend to like, and cultural touchstones.
2. There are very few verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, or pronouns. Setting aside the fact that there is no widely-understood grammar that could tie these together — there simply aren’t enough basic building blocks to express many common thoughts in emoji.
3. Reviewing lists of common English words, emoji is missing obvious representations of the many of the most common words found in English (and, presumably, most other languages).
4. The current emoji submission process does not seem driven by a process likely to fill in the missing pieces soon, or in a systematic manner.

But, given sufficient interest and organization, this state of affairs can be changed.

## Words without obvious emoji

To motivate the current situation with concrete examples, here’s a list of very common English words which Emojese struggles to express in emoji. The Frequency number gives the word’s position in a list of 500 most frequent words in the [Oxford English Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Corpus). (Frequency analysis by [sketchengine.eu](https://www.sketchengine.eu/english-word-list/).) While the OEC may not be representative of contemporary text messages that include emoji, if a word is in the OEC’s top 500, it’s an _extremely_ common English word.

As with “narrow”, Emojese uses lines and arrows to suggest width. Here: ⟷ Long Left Right Arrow between two instances of \| Light Vertical Bar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \|⟷\|                                                                    |

One icon for <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?ar">year</a> shows a complete <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=year&i=2612190">orbit around the sun</a>. Emojese accomplishes the latter via ⥁ Clockwise Closed Circle Arrow around the ☀️ Sun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ⥁☀️                                                                      |
