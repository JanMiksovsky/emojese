# Challenges creating a visual language with emoji

Are there enough contemporary Unicode emoji to support visual communication of complex ideas entirely in reasonably recognizable emoji?

No — at least, not yet. Too much is missing.

The [Emojese emoji language](https://emojese.org) project takes a shot at assigning intuitive emoji representations of a reasonably large vocabulary for general communication. There are already enough emoji to make that possible, but many common words have no obvious representation emoji.

1. While there are some 1300 emoji (not counting skin tones), they are over-concentrated in a few areas, particularly facial expressions, hearts, animals, foods, occupations, and cultural touchstones.
2. There are very few verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, or pronouns. Setting aside the fact that there is no widely-understood grammar that could tie these together — there simply aren’t enough basic building blocks to express many common thoughts in emoji.
3. Reviewing lists of common English words, emoji is missing obvious representations of the many of the most common words found in English (and, presumably, most other languages).
4. The current emoji submission process does not seem driven by a process likely to fill in the missing pieces soon, or in a systematic manner.

But, given sufficient interest and organization, this state of affairs can be changed.

## Words without obvious emoji

To motivate the current situation with concrete examples, here’s a list of very common English words which Emojese struggles to express in emoji. The Frequency number gives the word’s position in a list of 500 most frequent words in the [Oxford English Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Corpus). (Frequency analysis by [sketchengine.eu](https://www.sketchengine.eu/english-word-list/).) While the OEC may not be representative of contemporary text messages that include emoji, if a word is in the OEC’s top 500, it’s an _extremely_ common English word.

Emojese uses 🎒 Backpack and → Rightwards Arrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 🎒→              | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_carry_2696191.svg" style="width: 200px">          |
| catch                    |        | There are balls like ⚾ Baseball, but sadly no catcher’s mitt, or anything else to directly show someone catching something.

Emojese uses 🏁 Chequered Flag for its association with the end of an auto race, but this meaning may be lost on many people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 🏁               |
| expect                   |        | 🤰 Pregnant Woman seems the closest, although the direct meaning of pregnancy likely distracts from the abstract notion of expecting something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 🤰               |
| fall (action)            |        | No obvious representation of something actively falling. Emojese uses 🍁 Maple Leaf for its association with falling leaves. (Ironically, 🍂 Fallen Leaf doesn’t seem to convey that as well, as the leaves may be interpreted to have already fallen.) The metaphoric association can work, but an icon showing something falling (like a <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=fall&i=1887964">person falling</a>) would be clearer.                                                                                                                   | 🍁               | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_falling_1887964.svg" style="width: 200px">        |
| fall (season)            |        | Adopting 🍁 Maple Leaf for the verb “fall” (above) means that emoji cannot also be used on its own to unambiguously reference the season. Emojese generally uses ⏰ Alarm Clock to represent the concept of time, so: “falling leaf time”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 🍁⏰             |
| far                      | 285    | No emoji clearly expresses <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=distance">distance</a>. Emojese uses a resultative complement (see “become”) to show ⛺ Tent close up, followed by 🏕 Camping with a smaller tent. This comparison works much better in emoji sets like Apple’s than in Microsoft’s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ⛺🏕️             | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_far_3014025.svg" style="width: 200px">            |
| farm                     |        | There is 🧑‍🌾 Farmer and 🚜 Tractor, but no farm.

| feel                     | 216    | Another challenging abstract concept. There are many emoji for feelings, but none to represent the general state or concept of feeling thing. Emojese uses categorization brackets (see “animal” above) to represent the general category of feelings, plus ⇝ Rightwards Squiggle Arrow to convey action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [😀]⟿            |                                                                                         |

| fork                     |        | There’s 🍴 Fork and Knife and 🔪 Kitchen Knife, but no fork. Emojese resorts to a rebus, using ➖ Minus Sign to subtract the knife from the fork and knife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 🍴➖🔪           | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_fork_1819231.svg" style="width: 200px">           |
| front                    |        | Same problem as “back”.

| garden                   |        | There’s 🌱 Seedling and several other plant emoji, but none for a place with plants.

| get                      | 71     | No obvious emoji for this common action. Numerous icons for "get" include something moving into a person’s hands. Emojese uses ↤ Leftwards Arrow from Bar to suggest something coming toward the speaker (represented to the left).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ↤                | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_get_1899024.svg" style="width: 200px">            |

| hard (substance)         | 302    | In English, 🪵 Wood is often used to express something being hard, but on its own is ambiguous. Emojese adds ✋Raised Hand to suggest physical sensations, here one of touching hard wood.

| have                     | 20     | After the various forms of “to be” (represented in Emojese with a “=” equals sign), “have” appears to be the most common verb in English. But there is no emoji showing someone holding something or otherwise suggesting possession; see “bring”. Emojese uses 💁 Person Tipping Hand in its possible interpretation as someone holding an object.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 💁               | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_own_3067162.svg" style="width: 200px">            |

Emojese uses a resultative complement (see “become”), with ◌ Dotted Circle transitioning to ○ White Circle to suggest something becoming more real.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ◌○               |
| restaurant               |        | Given the prevalence of food emoji, it’s surprising there is no obvious emoji for a location that serves food. Emojese uses 🥡 Takeout Box, adding 📍 Round Pushpin for “place”: “takeout food place”. This unfortunately focuses too much on ordering food to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 🥡📍             | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_Restaurant_2662746.svg" style="width: 200px">     |
| river, stream            |        | As with “lake”, there is no emoji for this common geographical feature. Sadly, it appears that a proposal for <a href="http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19334-river-emoji.pdf">River</a> was rejected. Emojese uses 💧 Droplet for “water”, plus \| Vertical Bar to suggest a flowing river.

| safe (adjective)         |        | No obvious emoji for this admittedly challenging abstract concept. Emojese uses 🦺 Safety Vest, although that has a nuance of mitigating the dangers of a dangerous situation, rather than the intended meaning of being safe from harm. An <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=safety&i=1490820">icon</a> showing someone or thing being protected might be clearer.                                                                                                                                                                                  | 🦺               |
| seed                     |        | There is 🌱 Seedling but no generic seed. While 🥜 Peanuts and 🌰 Chestnut both represent seeds, neither seems sufficiently generic. (Putting both into a category would likely suggest nuts specifically.) An icon <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=seed">seed</a> might show a seed being planted. Emojese uses 🪴 Potted Plant and 🥚 Egg: “plant egg”.                                                                                                                                                                                          | 🪴🥚             | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_seeding_3541933.svg" style="width: 200px">        |
| sell                     |        | As with “buy”, there is no obvious emoji for the selling side of a financial transaction. Emojese uses ⬚ Dotted Square, ⇆ Leftwards Arrow Over Rightwards Arrow, and 💵 Dollar Banknote to denote exchanging a thing to acquire money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ⬚⇆💵             |

Here: ⟷ Long Left Right Arrow between two instances of \| Light Vertical Bar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \|⟷\|            |
| winter                   |        | See “fall” (season). Emojese uses ❄️ Snowflake: “snow time”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ❄️⏰             |
| year                     | 121    | As with “week” and “month”, there is no emoji for this division of time. One icon for <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?ar">year</a> shows a complete <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=year&i=2612190">orbit around the sun</a>. Emojese accomplishes the latter via ⥁ Clockwise Closed Circle Arrow around the ☀️ Sun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ⥁☀️              | <img src="../static/experimental/noun_year_2612190.svg" style="width: 200px">           |
