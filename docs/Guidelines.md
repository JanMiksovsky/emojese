# Guidelines for representing words with emojis

Because there are [many common words with no obvious emoji representation](./Challenges.md), the Emojese emoji language project resorts to a number of strategies to produce understandable and memorable emoji sequences.

## General guidelines

- Consider the full range of Unicode, not just emoji characters. The [Compart Unicode search tool](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode) is excellent for this purpose.
- Make judicious use of mathematical symbols and arrows. See below.
- Big, obvious distinctions are better than small, subtle ones. When sent in a messaging application, emojis can appear very small, making fine details hard to discern.
- Choose emoji which, if not obvious, are at least recognizable, memorable, and sensible in retrospect. Few people would type 🐛🦋 for “become” on their own, but hopefully in retrospect the choice of those emoji makes sense.
- The more common an idea is, ideally the shorter its emoji expression should be.
- There's no need to reproduce standard emoji definitions. There is no Emojese definition for "cat", for example, because the 🐈 emoji already has the standard English description "cat", and typing "cat" in the app already produces that emoji.
- Be aware that emoji representations vary from platform to platform, which can occasionally present challenges. For example, the contrast in 🏕️⛺ ("near") works well in iOS and other platforms, but poorly in Microsoft Windows.
- Avoid using text to convey meaning. Avoid emoji with words like 🆓, with the exception of 🆗 ("ok" is nearly universally understood). Text for proper nouns is fine.
- Similarly, avoid letters to imply English words for those letters. 🄰 is used for "letter", not for words that start with "a". Exception: 🚗Ⓟ is used for "park" because many international parking signs include a "P" in a circle.
- Unless gender or skin tone is an important aspect of the word, use the genderless people emoji like 🧑 rather than gendered alternatives. Messages about specific people can use more specific genders.
- Likewise, generally use the default yellow skin tone.
- Be family-friendly. It's unclear whether adding entries like 🍆 would actually make this more fun.
- [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) is a reasonably definitive emoji reference.

## Parts of speech indicators

Emojis tend to be things, which leads to interpreting them as nouns. These indicators can emphasize that a different part of speech is intended. Such an indicator may not always be required.

| Emojese | Meaning            |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| ~       | adjective ("-ish") |
| ⟿       | verb               |

## Abstract concepts and combining forms

Emojese tries to identify certain emoji as representative of a broader concept, then use this in combination with other emojis to create new words. These are used like [radicals](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)>) in Chinese and Japanese characters; they contribute a semantic meaning to the sequence.

## Prepositions

These generally use Unicode symbols that suggest a position or relationship.

| Emojese | Meaning      |
| ------- | ------------ |
| ◓       | above, over  |
| ⤼       | across       |
| →←      | against      |
| ⥁       | around       |
| ◑       | after        |
| @       | at           |
| ◐       | back, behind |
| ◒       | below, under |
| ⧲       | between      |
| ⩕       | by           |
| ⬇️      | down         |
| ↫       | from         |
| ◑       | front        |
| 📥      | in           |
| ⚆       | inside       |
| ⇲       | into         |
| ↥       | off          |
| ⊻       | on           |
| 📤      | out          |
| ⧂       | outside      |
| ◓       | over         |
| ⤃       | through      |
| ↬       | to, for      |
| ⬆️      | up           |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑      | with         |

## Arrows

Although arrows are effective at communicating action and there are many Unicode arrows, they can be hard to tell apart and a row of different arrows is very hard to visually read. Emojese tries to avoid using too many different types of slightly different arrows; something about the arrow itself (direction, count, line quality, start/end decoration) should suggest the meaning.

Generally speaking, action toward the speaker is to the left; action away from the speaker is to the right.

| Emojese | Meaning        |

| ↩       | return         |
| ↱       | right          |

| ⇒       | then           |
| ⍆       | through        |

## Comparison (resultative complement)

In cases where there are two emoji that have some interesting juxtaposition, Emojese may use a Mandarin-style <a href="https://eastasiastudent.net/china/mandarin/result-complement-detail-explanation/">resultative complement</a>. This contrasts two ideas and focusing on the second to imply a change, difference, or result:

| Emojese | Meaning        |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 🐛🦋    | become, change |
| ⛺🏕️    | far            |
| 🏕️⛺    | near           |
| 🛌🛏     | wake up        |

## Categories

Categories appear in brackets.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| [🖼️]    | art     |
| [🐈🐕]  | pet     |
| [⚽]    | sports  |

## Metaphors

Emoji such as animals can be used for their metaphoric or symbolic value, often in combination with the "~" (-ish) adjective indicator.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| 🐘~     | big     |
| 🐝~     | busy    |
| 🦥~     | lazy    |
| 🪶~     | light   |
| 🐿️⟿     | prepare |

## Possessive marker

Emojese adopts the hiragana の (“no”) as a possessive, one of its uses in Japanese.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `🏁の`  | last    |
| `🌐の`  | online  |

## Mathematical, scientific, and musical notation

In a few cases, math, science, and music may have a notation with an existing meaning that can play a useful role in an Emojese word. The meaning may only be known to people with prior knowledge of that field, so this technique is used sparingly. That said, since some concepts are fundamentally abstract, _any_ emoji representation might be challenging to understand; it seems preferable to at least adopt an existing notation for such a concept.

| Emojese | Meaning           |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| ∀       | all               |
| ∃       | any, some, exists |
| ∵       | because           |
| ⌈       | ceiling, high     |
| ⌊       | floor, low        |
| ⟨ ⟩     | group             |
| ∯       | surface           |
| ⇒       | then              |

## Symbols drawn from the entirety of Unicode

In addition to emoji, Unicode contains some 140,000 other characters. Unlike the notation strategy above, here the original meaning of a character is often ignored, using it for its pictorial value as a kind of emoji.

| Emojese | Meaning  |
| ------- | -------- |
| ◡       | bottom   |
| ⏀       | center   |
| ⌥       | choose   |
| 〰️      | continue |
| ⟓       | corner   |
| ⌒       | curve    |
| ⍐       | enough   |
| 𐄪       | grid     |
| ⟢       | happen   |
| ⚆       | inside   |
| ⎋       | leave    |
| ⧂       | outside  |
| ◔       | part     |
| ▥       | pattern  |
| ᠁       | (plural) |
| ◌○      | real     |
| ▦       | screen   |
| 🝆       | several  |
| ⧛⧚      | shake    |
| ⎄       | shape    |
| ⟥       | side     |
| ⎈       | steer    |
| ⌼       | too      |
| ◠       | top      |
| ➿      | turn     |

## Emoji pictures

This is something of a last-resort strategy, as it tends to require multiple characters to get a simple point across.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| ⇥⇤      | narrow  |
| ┳┳      | table   |

## Rebus or "math"

This strategy is also rarely employed as it requires substantial mental work to understand. "Math" operations like ➕ and ➖ can be used to indicate that one concept should be added to, or subtracted from, another.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| 🍴➖🔪  | fork    |
| 🍽➖🍴   | plate   |
