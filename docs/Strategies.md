# Strategies for representing words with emojis

Because a wide number of words have no obvious emoji representation (see [challenges](./Challenges.md)), Emojese resorts to a number of strategies to produce emoji sequences.

## General strategies

- Consider the full range of Unicode, not just emoji characters.
- Make judicious use of mathematical symbols, including numbers. Recognize that few people will know the precise meaning of obscure mathematical symbols; it's best if the symbols are suggestive of their meanings.
- Reserve arrows for the most common words or constructions. It is tempting to use the hundreds of Unicode arrows to suggest a wide range of actions, but relying too heavily on subtly-different arrows produces visually confusing results. See "Arrows" below.
- Big, obvious distinctions are better than small, subtle ones. When sent in a messaging application, emojis can appear very small, making fine details hard to discern.
- Choose emoji which, if not obvious, are at least recognizable, memorable, and sensible in retrospect. Few people would type 🐛🦋 for “become” on their own, but hopefully in retrospect the choice of those emoji makes sense.
- The more common an idea is, ideally the shorter its emoji expression should be.
- There's no need to reproduce standard emoji definitions. There is no Emojese definition for "cat", for example, because the 🐈 emoji already has the standard English description "cat", and typing "cat" in the app already produces that emoji.
- Be aware that emoji representations vary from platform to platform, which can occasionally present challenges. For example, the contrast in 🏕️⛺ ("near") works well in iOS and other platforms, but poorly in Microsoft Windows.
- Unless gender or skin tone is an important aspect of the word, use the genderless people emoji like 🧑 in their default (typically yellow) skin tone.
- [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) is a reasonably definitive emoji reference.

## Parts of speech indicators

Emojis tend to be things, which leads to interpreting them as nouns. These indicators can emphasize that a different part of speech is intended. Such an indicator may not always be required.

~ adjective
⟿ verb

## Abstract concepts and combining forms

Emojese tries to identify certain emoji as representative of a broader concept, then use this in combination with other emojis to create new words.

∀ all
∃ any, some, exists
◡ bottom
〰️ continuation
☀️ day, day of week
💀 death
🧭 direction
♾️ forever
↤ get
↦ give
🏛️ government, politics
⟨ ⟩ group
🖐 hand, touching
⌈ high
🌐 internet
🎓 knowledge
⇊ less
⌊ low
⚙️ machine, device
🔨 make
💍 marriage
💭 mental activity
🍖 meat (combine with animal for type)

⏭️ next
🚫 not, negate
\# number
👥 people (multiple)
👤 person (abstract concept)
🧑 person (combining form for an occupation without a specific emoji)

🤏 small
🧪 substance
∯ surface

🌍 world

## Prepositions

These generally use Unicode symbols that suggest a position or relationship.

◓ above, over
⤼ across
⥁ around
◑ after
@ at
◐ back, behind
◒ below, under
⧲ between
⩕ by
⬇️ down
↫ from
◑ front
📥 in
⚆ inside
⇲ into
↥ off
⊻ on
📤 out
⧂ outside
◓ over
⤃ through
↬ to, for
⬆️ up
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 with

## Comparison (resultative complement)

In cases where there are two emoji that have some interesting juxtaposition, Emojese may use a Mandarin-style <a href="https://eastasiastudent.net/china/mandarin/result-complement-detail-explanation/">resultative complement</a>. This contrasts two ideas and focusing on the second to imply a change, difference, or result:

🐛🦋 become, change
⛺🏕️ far
🏕️⛺ near
🛌🛏 wake up

## Categories

Categories appear in brackets.

[🥞] breakfast
[⚽] sports

## Possessive marker

🏁 の last
⇊ の least

## Rebus

🍴−🔪 fork
🍽−🍴 plate

## Emoji pictures

⇥⇤ narrow
┳┳ table

## Arrows

Although arrows are effective at communicating action, Emojese tries to avoid using too many different types of arrows.

Generally speaking, action toward the speaker is to the left; action away from the speaker is to the right.

← come
↬ for
↫ from
↤ get
↦ give
→ go
↰ left
⇊ less
⇈ more
⤺ (past tense)
↩ return
↱ right
