# Strategies for representing words with emojis

Because a wide number of words have no obvious emoji representation (see [challenges](./Challenges.md)), Emojese resorts to a number of strategies to produce emoji sequences.

## Comparison (resultative complement)

In cases where there are two emoji that have some interesting juxtaposition, Emojese may use a Mandarin-style <a href="https://eastasiastudent.net/china/mandarin/result-complement-detail-explanation/">resultative complement</a>. This contrasts two ideas and focusing on the second to imply a change, difference, or result:

🐛🦋 become, change
⛺🏕️ far
🏕️⛺ near
🛌🛏 wake up

## Categories

Categories appear in brackets.

[🥞] breakfast
[⚽] sports

## Possessive marker

🏁 の last
⇊ の least

## Rebus

🍴−🔪 fork
🍽−🍴 plate

## Symbolic meaning

⚆ inside
⧂ outside

## Emoji pictures

## Arrows

Although arrows are effective at communicating action, Emojese tries to avoid using too many different types of arrows.

Generally speaking, action toward the speaker is to the left; action away from the speaker is to the right.

← come
↬ for
↫ from
↤ get
↦ give
→ go
↰ left
⇊ less
⇈ more
⤺ (past tense)
↩ return
↱ right
