## Comparison (resultative complement)

In cases where there are two emoji that have some interesting juxtaposition, Emojese may use a Mandarin-style <a href="https://eastasiastudent.net/china/mandarin/result-complement-detail-explanation/">resultative complement</a>. This contrasts two ideas and focusing on the second to imply a change, difference, or result:

🐛🦋 become, change

🏕️⛺ near
🛌🛏 wake up
