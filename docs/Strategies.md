# Strategies for representing words with emojis

Because a wide number of words have no obvious emoji representation (see [challenges](./Challenges.md)), Emojese resorts to a number of strategies to produce emoji sequences.

## General strategies

- Consider the full range of Unicode, not just emoji characters.
- Make judicious use of mathematical symbols, including numbers. Recognize that few people will know the precise meaning of obscure mathematical symbols; it's best if the symbols are suggestive of their meanings.
- Reserve arrows for the most common words or constructions. It is tempting to use the hundreds of Unicode arrows to suggest a wide range of actions, but relying too heavily on subtly-different arrows produces visually confusing results. See "Arrows" below.
- Big, obvious distinctions are better than small, subtle ones. When sent in a messaging application, emojis can appear very small, making fine details hard to discern.
- Choose emoji which, if not obvious, are at least recognizable, memorable, and sensible in retrospect. Few people would type 🐛🦋 for “become” on their own, but hopefully in retrospect the choice of those emoji makes sense.
- The more common an idea is, ideally the shorter its emoji expression should be.
- There's no need to reproduce standard emoji definitions. There is no Emojese definition for "cat", for example, because the 🐈 emoji already has the standard English description "cat", and typing "cat" in the app already produces that emoji.
- Be aware that emoji representations vary from platform to platform, which can occasionally present challenges. For example, the contrast in 🏕️⛺ ("near") works well in iOS and other platforms, but poorly in Microsoft Windows.
- Unless gender or skin tone is an important aspect of the word, use the genderless people emoji like 🧑 in their default (typically yellow) skin tone.
- [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) is a reasonably definitive emoji reference.

## Parts of speech indicators

Emojis tend to be things, which leads to interpreting them as nouns. These indicators can emphasize that a different part of speech is intended. Such an indicator may not always be required.

| Emojese | Meaning            |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| ~       | adjective ("-ish") |
| ⟿       | verb               |

## Abstract concepts and combining forms

Emojese tries to identify certain emoji as representative of a broader concept, then use this in combination with other emojis to create new words.

## Prepositions

These generally use Unicode symbols that suggest a position or relationship.

| Emojese | Meaning      |
| ------- | ------------ |
| ◓       | above, over  |
| ⤼       | across       |
| ⥁       | around       |
| ◑       | after        |
| @       | at           |
| ◐       | back, behind |
| ◒       | below, under |
| ⧲       | between      |
| ⩕       | by           |
| ⬇️      | down         |
| ↫       | from         |
| ◑       | front        |
| 📥      | in           |
| ⚆       | inside       |
| ⇲       | into         |
| ↥       | off          |
| ⊻       | on           |
| 📤      | out          |
| ⧂       | outside      |
| ◓       | over         |
| ⤃       | through      |
| ↬       | to, for      |
| ⬆️      | up           |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑      | with         |

## Arrows

Although arrows are effective at communicating action and there are many Unicode arrows, they can be hard to tell apart and a row of different arrows is very hard to visually read. Emojese tries to avoid using too many different types of arrows.

Generally speaking, action toward the speaker is to the left; action away from the speaker is to the right.

| Emojese | Meaning        |
| ------- | -------------- |
| ←       | come           |
| ↬       | for            |
| ↫       | from           |
| ⤻       | (future tense) |
| ↤       | get            |
| ↦       | give           |
| →       | go             |
| ↰       | left           |
| ⇊       | less           |
| ⇈       | more           |
| ⤺       | (past tense)   |
| ↩       | return         |
| ↱       | right          |

## Comparison (resultative complement)

In cases where there are two emoji that have some interesting juxtaposition, Emojese may use a Mandarin-style <a href="https://eastasiastudent.net/china/mandarin/result-complement-detail-explanation/">resultative complement</a>. This contrasts two ideas and focusing on the second to imply a change, difference, or result:

| Emojese | Meaning        |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 🐛🦋    | become, change |
| ⛺🏕️    | far            |
| 🏕️⛺    | near           |
| 🛌🛏     | wake up        |

## Categories

Categories appear in brackets.

| Emojese | Meaning   |
| ------- | --------- |
| [🥞]    | breakfast |
| [🐈🐕]  | pet       |
| [⚽]    | sports    |

## Metaphors

Emoji such as animals can be used for their metaphoric or symbolic value, often in combination with the "~" (-ish) adjective indicator.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| 🐘~     | big     |
| 🐝~     | busy    |
| 🪨~     | dumb    |
| 🦥~     | lazy    |
| 🪶~     | light   |
| 🐿️      | prepare |

## Possessive marker

Emojese adopts the hiragana の (“no”) as a possessive, one of its uses in Japanese.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| 🏁 の   | last    |
| ⇊ の    | least   |

## Emoji pictures

This is something of a last-resort strategy, as it tends to require multiple characters to get a simple point across.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| ⇥⇤      | narrow  |
| ┳┳      | table   |

## Rebus or "math"

This strategy is rarely employed as it requires substantial mental work to understand. "Math" operations like ➕ and ➖ can be used to indicate that one concept should be added to, or subtracted from, another.

| Emojese | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| 🍴➖🔪  | fork    |
| 🍽➖🍴   | plate   |
